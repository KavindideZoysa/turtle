                Both sea turtles and their parts continue to be harvested irresponsibly for human consumption and trade.
                Many people throughout the globe rely on turtle meat and eggs as a source of sustenance and income. 
                Some also slaughter tortoises for medicinal purposes and religious rituals. Each year, tens of thousands
                of sea turtles are killed in this manner, decimating populations of the already endangered green and
                hawksbill turtles.
                Also ongoing is the slaughter of tortoises for both domestic and international markets. The international
                trade of all species of sea turtles and their parts is prohibited by the Convention on International 
                Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), a global agreement regulating or 
                prohibiting international trade in threatened species. Illegal trafficking continues to exist.

                Nesting sea turtles are dependent on coastlines. Globally, nesting beaches for sea turtles have been
                directly destroyed or disturbed by uncontrolled coastal development, vehicular traffic on beaches, and 
                other human activities. For instance, the lights from roads and buildings disorient hatchlings away 
                from the ocean, and vehicle traffic on beaches compacts the sediment, preventing female turtles from 
                digging nests. Turtle feeding grounds, such as coral reefs and seagrass meadows, are harmed and 
                devastated by onshore activities, such as sedimentation from land clearance and nutrient runoff from 
                agriculture. Through dredging and sand filling, it has been discovered that beach restoration initiatives 
                designed to safeguard seaside structures are also detrimental.

                Even the sex of progeny is affected by environmental conditions such as temperature during all phases 
                of a sea turtle's life. As a consequence of climate change-induced abnormally mild temperatures, there 
                are now fewer male hatchlings.Warmer sea surface temperatures can also result in the loss of vital 
                foraging grounds for sea turtles, while more intense storms and rising sea levels can decimate and 
                damage nesting beaches

                POLLUTION

            <p class="threatpara">
                Plastic debris that floats in the water can be mistaken by sea turtles for jellyfish, causing them to 
                suffocate when they attempt to consume it. Frequently, these encounters are catastrophic. Lost or 
                abandoned fishing gear, known as ghost gear, can entangle sea turtles and cause them to suffocate or 
                become unable to feed or swim. Litter on coastlines can prevent hatchlings from reaching the ocean by 
                trapping them. Additionally, oil accidents poison sea turtles of all ages.

        BUT THE AUTHORITIES HAVE TAKEN MEASURES TO CONSERVE TURTLES...

                Protecting marine turtle habitats
            </h3>
            <p class="conpara">
                WWF works around the world to establish marine protected areas, ensuring sea turtles have a safe place 
                to nest, feed, and migrate freely. We encourage governments to strengthen legislation on, and provide 
                funding for, sea turtle protection. WWF supports local turtle conservationists in many parts of the 
                world to monitor and patrol turtle nests. These efforts often lead to ecotourism opportunities and offer 
                alternative livelihoods.

                Minimizing the impact from climate changes
            </h3>
            <p class="conpara">
                WWF studies how sea turtles are being affected by climate change and helps determine the best ways to 
                reduce their vulnerability to changing environmental conditions. We work around the world with 
                communities to monitor and protect nesting beaches, helping turtles be more resilient to the future 
                impacts of climate change. In the Eastern Pacific and Caribbean, we work to raise awareness of the 
                threat of sea level rise on nest sites and the importance of shade for nests.

                Satellite tracking
            </h3>
            <p class="conpara3">
                Satellite telemetry allows researchers to track sea turtles as they swim from place to place. These 
                satellite tags do not harm the turtles in any way and are designed to eventually fall off. The data will 
                tell us where important feeding areas are, help us understand migration patterns and anticipate where 
                turtles may come in contact with fisheries and their gear.

        Sri Lanka has additionally taken steps to protect turtles by instituting a number of conservation initiatives. 
        In addition to the numerous conservation facilities that are dedicated to caring for turtles and educating 
        residents about the need of preserving their species, there are also multiple companies and communities who have 
        made it a priority to invest in the protection of these valuable creatures.
